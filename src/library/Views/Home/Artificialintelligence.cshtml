    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. 
        In computer science, an ideal "intelligent" machine is a flexible rational agent that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize
        its chance of success at some goal.
        Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics 
        "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".[2] As machines become increasingly capable, 
        mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar
        of "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology.[3] Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,
        competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as Chess and Go[5]), self-driving cars, and interpreting complex data. Some people also consider 
        AI a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly.[6] AI research is divided into subfields
        that focus on specific problems or on specific approaches or on the use of a particular tool or towards satisfying particular applications.
