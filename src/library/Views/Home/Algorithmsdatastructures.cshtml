    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.Data structures
        can implement one or more particular abstract data types (ADT), which specify the operations that can be performed on a data structure and the
        computational complexity of those operations. In comparison, a data structure is a concrete implementation of the specification provided by an ADT.
        <br />
        Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example,
        relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval,
        while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.
